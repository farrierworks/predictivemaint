to do:

merge failures_df with telemetry_df

classification:

features:

*days from last maintenance
days from last failure
*machineID
*model
*age
*normalized measurements
*rolling 5 day std dev of normalized measurements

* = feature already created

labels:
0=no failure
1=failure

classification algos:
-CNN
-K nearest

#not sure if theres enough data to effectively predict which component would fail
labels - stage 2 classification:
0=no failure
1 = comp 1 failure
2 = comp 2 failure
3 = comp 3 failure
4 = comp 4 failure

additional features:
RSI of measurements
EMA / MA of measurements
